# Anthony Green Creative 
## Web development portfolio

### About this web site:
Online portfolio showcasing projects completed through University of Toronto's Web Development Bootcamp. I'll regularly add projects to the portfolio page upon completion. I will also showcase personal/professional web/visual design projects.

### January 24, 2019 updates:
* Polished look and feel
* Incorporated custom fonts from Google Fonts
* Reformatted portfolio page — larger images and added project descriptions
* Adjusted responsiveness of design
* Added LinkedIn and GitHub profile links to footer

### Outstanding tasks:
* Create sticky title/nav bar (fix to top of browser upon scroll)
* Incorporate design/illustration work to portfolio — separate page from web dev work?
* Finesse ‘about me’ content
